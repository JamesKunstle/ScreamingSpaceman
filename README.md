# ScreamingSpaceman
Project by Hayden Gebhardt and James Kunstle (6/25/20)

Uses a wrapper on the International Space Station API to determine it's current location
as well as Geocoder to determine the current location of the machine running the Python3 script.

Then, communicates with an arduino for some wacky shenanigans.
